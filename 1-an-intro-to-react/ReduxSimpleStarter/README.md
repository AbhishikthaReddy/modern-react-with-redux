##Files for the various projects in Udemy class Modern React with Redux by Stephen Grider
---

This is my working directory as I go through this class. Each project will have it's own sub directory. I just wanted a place to keep everything.

>Note: my code may differ from Stephen's as I experiment with things as I go along. So I make no guarantees that it will perform the same way that his code does.

If you are interested in this class, you should have prior knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. From what I can tell, this class starts off right where [Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp) left off (currently at lecture 273 but he is adding more content so this may not always be the case). I highly recommend Colt's class if you want to get started, he does a great job and there is a very active community on his gitter channel.

For me this is perfect. Many of the other classes start off at the beginning of web development and it is hard to sit through another "this is a var" video.
In opening section, Stephen assumes:

 - You have Node.js installed because he has you run npm install right off the bat
 - You know what document.querySelector('.container') does.
If you don't know what I am talking about, go back and see Colt or hit up [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com)
